# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Environment

- **Host:** GitHub Codespaces
- **Project Path:** `/workspaces/MyOpenClawBot`
- **Repository:** `https://github.com/Vicr666/MyOpenClawBot`
- **Public URL Base:** `https://literate-orbit-w4jp9wxgg6qc5w6r` (port will be appended, e.g. -3000.app.github.dev)
- **User Provided Link:** `https://literate-orbit-w4jp9wxgg6qc5w6r-18789.app.github.dev`

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Workflow

- **Auto-Push:** Always commit and push changes to the repository after completing coding tasks.
- **Preview:** After starting the dev server, construct the public URL (e.g., `https://literate-orbit-w4jp9wxgg6qc5w6r-3000.app.github.dev`) and send it to the user.
- **Port Management:** Check for port conflicts before starting. Default to 3000.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
